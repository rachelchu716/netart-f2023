    <h1>Project 3: Net Art Exhibition</h1>   
    <div>
      <p> <h2>Call It What You Want</h2> </p>

The main theme is abstract realism. It is defined as an oxymoronic fusion of web artifacts that already exist and are based on philosophical reasoning. The three pieces I’ve curated for this art exhibition are art that exist as they are, but also appear conceptual. One’s perception sees the known object based on the context, but they also elicit responses of “is this what it is? Surely it could be something else”. Therefore, this exhibit was named “Call It What You Want” because the pieces are up for discussion based on the viewer’s discretion. In the first piece, the plugin (now Chrome extension) displays the pieces of code on a page and turns them into colored blocks. It <em> is </em> a website but is impractical in terms of what a website does, so can we say it is really a website? In the second one, it contains the legal documents of Kristin Lucas from her legal case of changing her name from “Kristin Sue Lucas” to “Kristin Sue Lucas”. Can it be called change if the characters in the same remain the same? In the last one, it’s actually a collection of art from Jon Rafman’s tumblr page specialized for screenshots taken from Google Street View. It is meant to be pictures taken from a neutral robot camera with no human intention or conscious artistic thought, unlike human photographers. But is the collection really neutral? Can Jon Rafman really maintain the statement that his Tumblr page doesn’t have any biases behind each picture? These three pieces represent a mixture of philosophical debate and things that exist as they are, so I hope you enjoy this exhibition as much as I did examining each piece!
