  This art exhibition’s primary theme is surveillance. The main focus is on the parallel between reality and all forms of Internet documentation. <br> This includes photography and can be from a corporation, a couple, or a single person. 
  <br> 
  <br>
  All 3 pieces emphasize that anything experienced in real life can be viewed on the Internet, with the culture of social media. It calls into question the idea of Internet privacy, but in reality, Internet users monitor themselves– anything that is typed or uploaded by a user on the Internet, displays a bit of the user or subject’s behavior and characteristics in real life.

 <br> Exhibit 1 - “Nine Eyes of Google Street View” by Jon Rafman is an ongoing online collection of screenshots of Google Street view’s camera with nine lenses. Unlike many cameras used by large corporations, the nine lenses of a Google Maps camera does not take pictures to monitor people, it simply captures the environment of all the reachable locations. It takes an annual slice of life from random passersby and uploads this data to the Internet, where it is displayed publicly.
  <br> <br> Exhibit 2 - “Life Sharing” by Eva and Franco Mattes was a year-long project commissioned by the Walker Art Center to publicly display and document every piece of data inside their home computer. The information contained in this machine represented the Mattes’ actions, personalities, interests, and hobbies throughout that year.
   <br> <br> Exhibit 3 - “I’m Here and There” by Jonas Lund was a virtual performance that displayed Lund’s web browsing activity in real time, allowing anyone to see what kind of data web browsers collect about users. It instigated the debate of Internet user privacy and corporation surveillance
