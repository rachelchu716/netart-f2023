    <h1>Project 3: Net Art Exhibition</h1>   
    <div>
      <p> <h2>Public Privacy</h2> </p>
<body>
  This art exhibition’s primary theme is surveillance. The main focus is on the parallel between reality and all forms of Internet documentation. <br> This includes photography and can be from a corporation, a couple, or a single person. 
  <br> 
  <br>
  All 3 pieces emphasize that anything experienced in real life can be viewed on the Internet, with the culture of social media. It calls into question the idea of Internet privacy, but in reality, Internet users monitor themselves– anything that is typed or uploaded by a user on the Internet, displays a bit of the user or subject’s behavior and characteristics in real life.
