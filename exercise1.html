<p> <h1>Enchanted (Taylor's Version)</h1> </p>
<p> (but it's just the chorus) </p>
<body>
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
<br> I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
<br> I'll spend forever wondering if you knew that
<br> This night is flawless, don't you let it go
<br> I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
<br> I'll spend forever wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet you.
