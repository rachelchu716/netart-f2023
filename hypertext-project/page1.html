  <p> now that i'm slightly older, the motive of all of my cooking is rooted in nostalgia<br>
    and family time. whether it is recreating a dish my parents cooked for the family<br>
    growing up, or learning from a new recipe to cook for my parents now, it is all done<br>
    in love. <br>
<br>
please join me in recreating a nostalgic recipe. i'll be pulling precious<br>
memories from my toolbelt as well. </p>
