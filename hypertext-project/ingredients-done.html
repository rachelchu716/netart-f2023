  <p> when my older brother and i were kids, dad had tried to teach us how to fold<br>
    dumplings the traditional way, but the store-bought dumpling skins were dusted in<br>
    more flour than the ones my parents folded as kids, so the crimps simply wouldn't<br>
crimp.<br>
<br>
mom instead taught us to fold dumplings by running a wet finger along the<br>
circumference of the interior of the dumpling, folding the circular skin upwards,<br>
(hamburger-style), and pinching the edges together. the wet finger turned the<br>
flour and water mixture into a paste that glued the edges shut.</p>
